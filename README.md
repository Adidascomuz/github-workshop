### GitHub Workshop Guide:

This Workshop will teach you the fundamentals of GitHub, security strategy and essentials on GitHub and how to use GitHub actions to enable CI/CD across your repositories.

GitHub Actions is an advanced feature of GitHub that enables automation, artifact management and CI/CD natively. This workshop aims to educate you on how to implement these workflows across your projects on GitHub.

Your moderator will likely be vastly out numbered during your workshop - therefore please rely heavily on the documentation provided and available on [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/en). When you are complete, feel free to ask for feedback from your moderator and remember the best way to learn is to teach!

### Phase 1: Introduction to GitHub
  > **GitHub Fundamentals**
  1. Star this repository so we know you have taken this workshop!
  1. Fork this repository to your GitHub Account. (Fork button on top right of Repo)
  1. Go to the `Introduction to GitHub` [module](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)

**In this course, you’ll learn how to:**

- Communicate in issues
- Manage notifications
- Create branches
- Make commits
- Introduce changes with pull requests

### Phase 2: Security Strategy & Essentials:
  > **This course will show you how to build, host, and maintain a secure repository on GitHub.**
  1. Go to the `Security Essentials` [module](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/security-strategy-essentials)

  **In this course, you’ll learn how to:**
- Enable vulnerable dependency detection for private repositories
- Detect and fix outdated dependencies with security vulnerabilities
- Automate the detection of vulnerable dependencies with Dependabot
- Add a security policy with the a SECURITY.md file
- Remove a commit exposing sensitive data in a pull request
- Keep sensitive files out of your repository by leveraging the use of a .gitignore file
- Remove historical commits exposing sensitive data deep in your repository

### Phase 3: Create your first action
  > **The goal of Phase 2 is to Create a simple GitHub Action and use it in a workflow.**
  1. Go to the `hello world` [actions module](https://lab.github.com/github/hello-github-actions!)
  1. Review the official [GitHub Actions resources](https://github.com/alwell-kevin/awesome-actions#official-resources).

**In this phase, you’ll learn how to:**

- Organize and identify workflow files
- Add executable scripts
- Create workflow and action blocks
- Trigger workflows
- Discover workflow logs

### Phase 4: Continuous Integration with Actions
  > **The goal of Phase 3 is to Learn how to create workflows that enable you to use Continuous Integration (CI) for your projects.**
  1. Go to the `Continuous Integration` [actions module](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-actions:-continuous-integration)

**In this phase, you’ll learn how to:**

- Describe CI and why it is necessary
- Use and customize a templated workflow
- Create CI workflows that match the team's needs and behaviors
- Use the repository's source code and build artifacts (like compiled source code) across jobs in a workflow
- Implement a unit testing framework using GitHub Actions
- Create a workflow that runs tests and produces test reports
- Set up a matrix build to create build artifacts for multiple target platforms
- Save a repository's build artifacts
- Access saved build artifacts
- Choose virtual environments for the application's CI needs

### Phase 5: Publish your Artifact to GitHub Packages
  > **The goal of Phase 4 is to walk you through using GitHub Actions to get your code in a deployable state once your CI workflows have completed.**
  1. Go to the `Artifact Publishing` [actions module](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-actions:-publish-to-github-packages)

**In this phase, you’ll learn how to:**

- Describe CD and why it is necessary
- Use and customize a repository workflow
- Create CD workflows that matches the team's needs and behaviors
- Use the repository's source code to build artifacts and store them in the GitHub Packages
- Save repository build artifacts
- Access saved build artifacts

### Phase 6: Continuous Delivery
  > **FINAL: The goal of Phase 6 is to create a deployment workflow using Azure.**
  1. Go to the `Action Samples for deploying to Azure Web apps` [actions module](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-actions:-continuous-delivery-with-azure)
  2. Choose a sample app, and deploy it to Azure. 

**In this phase, you’ll learn how to:**

- Create multiple workflows
- Configure Azure for deployment
- Use secrets to store tokens
- Deploy to staging and production
- Practice using GitHub Actions

### Additional Documentation
